git add . 
will add all files in the current directory to the 


git commit -m "Created hello text file"
#this commits the change and the -m part is for any notes you want

git status
#shows the status of the current files

git diff
#shows what has been changed in the files

git diff tool
#Opens the differences in beyond compare (need to figure out how to do that)

git diff --staged
#shows the difference in the files that are staged from the already committed files

git log
git log --oneline
#shows the log of the history of commits, and the oneline part just shows a small amount of data

git log --oneline --graph
git log --oneline --graph --decorate
#shows a graphical output of the branching of the project.
#and decorate will add a bit more info showing things like the head and master of the project, and is very useful, so may be worth setting up a shortcut



crlf to lf line endings (need to look up)


git checkout .
#undoes all of the things to the currently staged version, this is the quick undo feature


head is the latest commit, to roll back to this we use

git reset --soft HEAD

and we can use ^ to reset to the one before the current commit, ^^ to get to the one before that, or ~5 will do a roll back to 5 commits ago
but here we will keep them all in the staging so that we dony't loose all the data.  however usign a hard reset will get it back 

git reset --hard
